You will be happy to discover that no longer will you have to produce orders or a meal card through the DFAC.  The only thing you must present is your ID card.   Personnel being in-processed here at CD will still receive the stamp on their orders, but however you will not have to show them to the Headcount at the DFAC.  Once again, all that is required once you walk through the DFAC is to show your ID card....
